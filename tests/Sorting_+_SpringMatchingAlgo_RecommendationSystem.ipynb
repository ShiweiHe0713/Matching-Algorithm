For the algorithm to work as intended both students and startups had to rank each other. While students are expected to match as many startups as possible that they want to work with, having startups rank students was deemed as added friction especially since they aren't guaranteed their best match. As a result, we want to have startups list out some sort of preferences for what they are looking from students instead of ranking students.\n","\n","## Solution:\n","One way to achieve the following is to implement a content based filtering algorithm used in early recommendation systems. Recommendation systems have been integrated well into our lives since the last decade- we have product recommendations come in based on products we have previously bought or looked at, and movie recommendations based off the movies we previously watched. While these algorithms are more advanced, a simple content based filtering algorithm does the following:\n","\n","Given a set of profiles and a feature set, we conduct a similarity metric for every profile against the feature set, and report the highest match.\n","\n","Refer: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/content-based/basics#:~:text=Content%2Dbased%20filtering%20uses%20item,previous%20actions%20or%20explicit%20feedback.\n","\n","To understand dot products, you can refer to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) to learn more."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":380,"status":"ok","timestamp":1695218355511,"user":{"displayName":"Mazhar Ali Baig","userId":"15803944771431989887"},"user_tz":360},"id":"TcZnGsi6GsLF"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from numpy.linalg import norm"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SbOv2xpNaVCD"},"source":["# Let's review a Matrix Operation\n","\n","Let us assume we have a 3x2 matrix A, where \\\n","A=$\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1 & 2\\\\\n","  3 & 4 \\\\\n","  5 & 6\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big)$, and a 2x1 matrix B, where B=$\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1 \\\\\n","  3\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big)$.\n","\n","Here we can consider every row in matrix A to be a row for each student and every row in matrix B to a feature for one startup.\n","\n","A dot product between one student and the startup would look like the following:\n","$student_1=\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1 & 2\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big)$ and $startup =\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1 \\\\\n","  3\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big)$\n","\n","$= \\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1 & 2\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big)$ . $\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1 \\\\\n","  3\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big) = \\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1*1 + & 2*3\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big) = 7$\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S-Havralf1aA"},"source":["Now if we do this for every student, we will perform the following operation where we will every row in matrix A and do a dot product with B, which is also similar to a matrix multiplication:\n","\n","A dot B = $\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1 & 2\\\\\n","  3 & 4 \\\\\n","  5 & 6\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big) . \\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  1\\\\\n","  3\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big) = \\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  7\\\\\n","  15\\\\\n","  23\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big)$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-B2HPNiAglYb"},"source":["What's important to note here is that the resulting matrix $\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}\n","  7\\\\\n","  15\\\\\n","  23\n","\\end{bmatrix}\\big)$ corresponds to the dot product result for every row in matrix A.\n","\n","Below, we will demo this operation in code."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fDtppb3JkW-M"},"source":["# So what's a Dot Product?\n","\n","Dot Product is a term taken out of Linear Algebra, which in simple words measures the similarity between two vectors.
